Overview

This project is a 2D Obstacle Avoidance Car Racing Game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The player controls a car moving on a vertical road using the left and right arrow keys and must avoid randomly generated obstacles. The game continues until the car collides with an obstacle, after which the final score is displayed.

Features

Smooth keyboard-controlled car movement

Random obstacle generation

Real-time collision detection

Dynamic score updates

Simple and user-friendly interface

Controls

Left Arrow (←): Move car left

Right Arrow (→): Move car right

1: Save first output screenshot

2: Save second output screenshot

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pygame library

Installation & Setup

Install Python 3.x from the official website

Install Pygame using:

pip install pygame


Clone the repository or download the source code

Run the game:

python race_car_game.py

Output Screens

The game displays a player-controlled car at the bottom of the screen with obstacles falling from the top. Screenshots of the running game can be captured using the keys 1 and 2.

Project Objective

To provide hands-on experience in developing an interactive 2D game using Python. The project demonstrates loops, conditions, event handling, object movement, collision detection, and real-time scoring.

Future Enhancements

Add car and road images

Increase difficulty levels

Include sound effects and background music

Implement pause and restart options
